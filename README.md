# Pong
 
This was a hobby project I created to get familiar with C# and Unity. It draws inspiration from Dartmouth's own style of Beer Pong, where the aim is to use a ping pong paddle with no handle to hit the ball into the opponent's cups. This game is for mobile devices, and I created a simple AI opponent to play against. I have not yet finished this game, and would love to come back to it one day once I have more time.
